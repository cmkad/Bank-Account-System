This is a quick project that emphasizes object-oriented programming principles in Python.
I've created a simple bank account system with multiple accounts, transactions, and the ability to track account balances.
The final result provides a simple text-based menu for creating accounts, making deposits, withdrawals, checking balances, and transferring money between accounts.
I hope you enjoy!
